<h1>Exoplanet Detection: The Transit Method</h1>
</center>

<hr>
<h3>General Description</h3>

<p>This program simulates the detection of exoplanets by using the transit method. In this method, the light curve from a star, and how it changes over time due to exoplanet transits, is observed and then analyzed. In this simulation the exoplanet orbits the star (sun-sized) in circular motion 
  via Kepler's third law.&nbsp; When the exoplanet passes in front of the star (transits), it blocks part of the starlight. This decrease in starlight is shown on the graph.&nbsp; If the exoplanet is close enough to the central star, and has sufficient reflectivity, or albedo, it can reflect enough of the starlight to be seen on the light curve. In the 
  simulation the star-exoplanet system is shown as seen from Earth (edge on view) but magnified greatly, and with the star and planet sizes not shown to the scale of the orbit. The radius of the 
  central star (relative to the radius of Sun),semi-major axis of the exoplanet (in AU), radius of the 
  exoplanet (relative to the radius of Jupiter), the exoplanet's albedo (reflectivity), and the inclination of the system relative to Earth can be 
  changed. </p>
<p>Since 1999,  over 85 exoplanets have been found via the transit method by primarily space-based telescopes such as CoRoT and Kepler. These exoplanets have radii varying from 0.15 to 1.80 R<sub>Jupiter</sub>, semi-major axes varying from 0.015 to 0.5 AU, and orbital periods varying from 1 to 111 days. They also have albedos ranging from 0.10-0.20 (or 10% - 20%). For comparison, Jupiter's albedo is 0.52 (or 52%). </p>
<p>The simulation uses Java 3D, if installed, to render the view the star and exoplanet. If Java 3D is not installed, the simulation will default to simple 3D using Java.</p>
<p>This simulation is part of a sequence of simulations used to introduce students to the 
detection of exoplanets.  
Additional simulations can be found on the OSP ComPADRE site.</p>

	<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Time Step: sets the time step so that the simulation can be sped up or slowed down to allow for faster times.
		<li>R/R_J Slider: changes the radius of the exoplanet (relative to the 
		radius of Jupiter).
	    <li>R_star/R_Sun Slider: changes the radius of the central (relative to the 
		radius of Sun).

        <li>Semi-major axis Slider: changes the semi-major axis of the exoplanet (AU).
          
      <li>Albedo Slider: changes the reflectivity of the exoplant (0-1).<li>Inclination Slider (right-hand side of the  
		View): changes the inclination of the system relative to Earth (default 
		value is edge on).
